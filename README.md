#### You can find me around the web:
- My [homepage](https://www.paulcutler.org) has more information about me and also hosts my blog, where I've been blogging about nothing for about twenty years.  Lately I've been blogging about learning Python and building an arcade cabinet.  It also includes a number of ways you can reach me.
- I'm not on most social networks except [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/prcutler) where I tweet about music and retweet a lot of political stuff. (You've been warned).

#### What I'm working on
- I'm currently working on my Python skills by building the Silver Saucer website.  I'm learning more about Pyramid web framework (the right way), Bootstrap and CSS, API integration (with Discogs), and how to test with `pytest`.
- I've started to tinker with electronics and hardware, specifically the Raspberry Pi.  It's fun to combine my budding Python skills with hardware.  I'm currently working on building a custom Raspberry Pi case with an LCD and button to remotely mute and control the volume of my Denon receiver.
