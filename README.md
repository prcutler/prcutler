#### You can find me around the web:
- My [homepage](https://www.paulcutler.org) has more information about me and also hosts my blog, where I've been blogging about nothing for about twenty years.  Lately I've been blogging about learning Python and building the `pi-dial` project.  It also includes a number of ways you can reach me.
- I'm not on most social networks except [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/prcutler) where I tweet about music and retweet a lot of political stuff. (You've been warned).

#### What I'm working on
- I've started to tinker with electronics and hardware, specifically the Raspberry Pi.  It's fun to combine my budding Python skills with hardware.  I just finished my `pi-dial` project, which uses a Raspberry Pi, a 3D printed enclosure, an LCD, and two rotary encoders to change the input, volume, and mute status of my Denon receiver over the network.
- I recently purchased a 3D Printer, a Creality Ender 3 v2, and I'm combining that with my interest in CircuitPython.
- My CircuitPython projects include an Adafruit Macropad, Sound Reactive Neopixels powered by a rp2040 Feather, a Media Dial, and another project just in the planning phase.
