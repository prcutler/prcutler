#### You can find me around the web:
- My [homepage](https://www.paulcutler.org) has more information about me and also hosts my blog, where I've been blogging about nothing for about twenty years.  I mostly blog about learning Python, CircuitPython, and my podcasts.  It also includes a number of ways you can reach me.
- ðŸŽ¤ I host [The CircuitPython Show](https://circuitpythonshow.com), an independent podcast about the people in and around CircuitPython. I also co-host [The Bootloader](https://www.thebootloader.net), a podcast where Tod Kurt and I bring you a few interesting things from the maker and tech scenes. If you enjoy either show, please tell a friend, write a review, or sponsor the show financially.  
- You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/prcutler) and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@prcutler) where I tweet about music, the podcasts, Python and CircuitPython, and maybe a little politics every now and then. (You've been warned).

#### What I'm working on (when not working on the podcasts)
- I continue to tinker with [silversaucer.com](https://silversaucer.com), a website I've built that integrates with my record collection using [Discogs](https://discogs.com).
- I'm continue to learn Python and CircuitPython. I have too many project to list, but I love hardware projects that use audio reactive lights.
- Writing and contributing documentation for open source projects
