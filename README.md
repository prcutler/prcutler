#### You can find me around the web:
- My [homepage](https://www.paulcutler.org) has more information about me and also hosts my blog, where I've been blogging about nothing for over twenty years.  I mostly blog about learning Python, CircuitPython, and my podcasts.  It also includes a number of ways you can reach me.
- ðŸŽ¤ I co-host [The Bootloader](https://thebootloader.net) podcast with Tod Kurt.  We chat about things going on in the maker scene monthly.  I use to host [The CircuitPython Show](https://circuitpythonshow.com), an independent podcast about the people in and around CircuitPython. which ran from 2022 - 2024.
- You can find me on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@prcutler" rel="me">Mastodon</a> where I toot about music, the podcast, Python and CircuitPython, and maybe a little politics every now and then. (You've been warned).
- ðŸ“· I share photos on [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/prcutler], usually records of what I'm currently playing.

#### What I'm working on (when not working on the podcast)
- I continue to tinker with [silversaucer.com](https://silversaucer.com), a website I've built that integrates with my record collection using [Discogs](https://discogs.com).
- I'm continuing to learn Python and CircuitPython. I have too many projects to list, but I love hardware projects that use audio reactive lights.
- Writing and contributing documentation for open source projects
