#### You can find me around the web:
- My [homepage](https://www.paulcutler.org) has more information about me and also hosts my blog, where I've been blogging about nothing for about twenty years.  Lately I've been blogging about learning Python and building the `pi-dial` project.  It also includes a number of ways you can reach me.
- I'm not on most social networks except [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/prcutler) where I tweet about music and retweet a lot of political stuff. (You've been warned).
- I host [The CircuitPython Show](https://circuitpythonshow.com), an independent podcast about the people in and around CircuitPython.
#### What I'm working on (when not working on the podcast)
- I continue to tinker with silversaucer.com, a website I've built that integrates with [Discogs](https://discogs.com).
- I'm learning electronics with Python and CircuitPython.  My projects so far include audio reactive lights built into a speakerstand, a Raspberry Pi powered project to control Zone 2 of my Denon receiver, a MacroPad, and an Adafruit PyPortal project that shows the album art for an album randomly chosen on silversaucer.com.
